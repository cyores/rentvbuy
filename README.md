# Rent vs Buy

Rent vs Buy is a tool that attempts to shed some light on the tough decision many people make: should I rent of house or buy a home?

The tool provides a full accounting of the costs of each decision using some user inputed data and a few assumptions (which can be found below).

The tool focuses on the sunk costs of each case and the appreciation of the assets in each case (real estate or stock market).

I am not a financial advisor. I do not have any formal financial or economic education. This tool is not substitute for real financial advice. It is only meant to help or supplement the decision making process.

<!-- The tool was largely inspired by this YouTube video by Ben Felix.

## Buy Case
The Buy sunk costs are as follows:
- initial taxes (ex. land transfer tax)
- annual property tax
- home maintenance
- interest on mortgage payments

Note that opportunity cost is not taken into account (at least for now). Having the Rent case calculations right beside the Buy case should illustrate the opportunity cost.

## Rent Case
The Rent sunk costs are as follows:
- monthly rent

## Assumptions
- The renter is investing in the stock market
- Real Estate Appreciation: 3% per year
- Stock Marcket Appreciation: 6% per year
- Home Maintenance: 1% of the value of the home per year
- Rent increases at the same rate as real estate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
